### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

For an optimal start-up, run the scripts that are with ("sass" and "prefix")
sass script : "npm install sass -g"
prefix script : "npm install autoprefixer postcss postcss-cli -g"

### Start-up commands ###
"node server", "run sass" and "run prefix"
